Description: This package provide two estimation method for calculating transfer entropy. One estimate transfer entropy through estimating mutual informatione and then calculating transfer entropy as difference of mutual information. The other uses kernel density estimation (KDE) method in which transfer entropy is estimated from a generalized correlation sum equation.
