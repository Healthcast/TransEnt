Description: Allows the calculation of the transfer entropy between two continuous valued random variables. Two estimation methods are provided. The first calculates transfer entropy as the difference of mutual information. Mutual information is estimated using the Kraskov method, which builds on a nearest-neighbor framework (see package references). The second estimation method estimate transfer entropy via the a generalized correlation sum.
